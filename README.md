You want to have this mod translated to your language? You know 2 languages? Then fork this repository (Click on "Fork" in the upper right). Navigate to /resources/assets/craftoflegends/lang/ and copy one of the lang-files. The new file needs to be named after your language-code. The code for your language can be found [here](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Language#Available_languages). Translate as much Text-Strings as you can *without* changing %1$s and similar. You can then create a new [Pull Request](https://github.com/ThexXTURBOXx/Craft-of-Legends/compare) and we will include your language into the mod. <br>

## I don't trust you... Where are the permissions? HUH? <br>
